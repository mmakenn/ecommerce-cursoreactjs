# Project: e-Commerce 

This e-commerce was created as the final project for the **React Js** course of [CODERHOUSE](https://www.coderhouse.com/)

I will appreciate your opinion and contribution to improve my skills.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install dependencies:

### `npm install`

## Run the app:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
